    comment = The Slug eats beach sand for nourishment, in between meals it is also a great wall for anything that doesn't have grass coverage. Stockpile let's you set up defenses, while recover keeps the slug healthy. It's natural special bulk and massive HP even lets it come in on a special attacker to setup without needing to be specially invested. Once Gastrodon is full on Stockpile, the Slug can even take some grass type attacks.
Even without Sp.Atk investment, Gastrodon still hits quite well, allowing it to two/three hit KO a lot of Pokémon, while threatening to status the ones it cannot take out fast. Scald let's it burn some threats it might not be able to defeat otherwise, Earth Power will drop Sp.Def to make sure even another wall isn't safe, Sludge Wave let's you spread poison while dealing damage and Clear Smog stops any attempt of a setup sweeper, that isn't a Steel type.
