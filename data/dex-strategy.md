Gastrodon
{
    name = The Slug
    item = Leftovers
    ability = Storm Drain
    evs = 252, 0, 252, 0, 4, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Bold/Relaxed
    moves = Stockpile, Scald, Earth Power/Sludge Wave/Clear Smog, Recover
    comment = The Slug eats beach sand for nourishment, in between meals it is also a great wall for anything that doesn't have grass coverage. Stockpile lets it set up its defenses, while Recover keeps the slug healthy. Its natural special bulk and massive HP even lets it come in on a special attacker to setup without needing to be specially invested. Once Gastrodon is full on Stockpile, the Slug can even take some grass type attacks.
Even without Sp.Atk investment, Gastrodon still hits quite well, allowing it to two/three hit KO a lot of Pokémon, while threatening to status the ones it cannot take out fast. Scald lets it burn some threats it might not be able to defeat otherwise, Earth Power will drop Sp.Def to make sure even another wall isn't safe, Sludge Wave lets you spread poison while dealing damage and Clear Smog stops any attempt of a setup sweeper, that isn't a Steel type.

Lopunny Mega
{
    name = Offensive Bunny
    item = Lopunnite
    ability = Scrappy
    evs = 0, 252, 4, 0, 0, 252 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Return, Fake Out, High Jump Kick/Close Combat, Play Rough/Triple Axel/U-Turn
    comment = Mega Lopunny is a massive offensive threat, as it hits any normal resist super effective with its fighting STAB and Scrappy allows it to hit Ghosts which would normally be immune to both its STABs. Mega Lopunnys high base speed also allows it to outspeed and KO most Pokémon that would otherwise be a threat to it. U-Turn allows to safely switch out against threats that it cannot KO while also dealing damage. Triple Axel allows it to break through Multiscale/Focus Sash, while Play Rough can be used to KO other Fighting types.

Breloom
{
    name = Swag
    item = Choice Band/Choice Scarf
    ability = Technician
    evs = 0, 252, 4, 0, 0, 252 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Mach Punch, Rock Tomb, Bullet Seed, Force Palm/Bulldoze
    comment = Brelooms high attack with the ability Technician wrecks havoc on a lot of Pokémon that want to set up or want to switch into it. Mach Punch deals a lot of damage to threats that would normally outspeed it, while Rock Tomb takes care of Flying types. Bullet Seed is amazing since every single hit is Technician boosted and Force Palm allows it to spread paralysis. 
Brelooms low base speed makes it hard for it to 2HKO Pokémon without risking to take massive damage back, however Breloom is a valid Pokémon to use!
